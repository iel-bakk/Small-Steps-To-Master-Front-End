# The Following Repo is Just a Playground

This repo is just a playground where I try some random stuff. You will find a README file describing some of the DOM-related stuff.
In Case you want to learn about the DOM or JavaScript, I advice you to read the MDN docs.
But you will require a basic knowledge of what is a tree , inhertance concept (OOP in GENERALE).
Feel free to reach out to me in case you have any questions.
## Enjoy .
