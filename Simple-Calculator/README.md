# A Simple Calculator Made Using DOM, JS, and CSS

This repository contains a simple calculator application built using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, along with CSS for styling.

## Overview

The calculator is structured into three main sections, designed to simplify the styling process.

### The First Section

The first section includes an input field and a button. The button is designed to remove the last character from the value property of the HTML input element. This allows users to easily correct their input.

### The Second Section

The second section is divided into two sub-sections:

- **The first sub-section** contains buttons for digits 0 through 9. Clicking on any of these buttons adds the corresponding digit to the input field.
- **The second sub-section** includes buttons for addition and subtraction symbols. These buttons allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

When a button is clicked, it adds the corresponding character to the input field's value property.

### The Third Section

The third section contains two buttons:

- **Clear**: This button clears the input field, allowing users to start a new calculation.
- **Calculate**: This button evaluates the expression inside the HTML input element's value property and displays the result.
